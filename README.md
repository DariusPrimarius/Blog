## Blog scaffolding

Written with laravel scaffolding. You can use it as you want. Users can make account, write post's, use search engine, upload photos. Blog include categories. 
SQL database server is obviously neccesary for working.

TO DO: 
    Search engine is little unsecure
    Better taging system
    implementing rest controller
